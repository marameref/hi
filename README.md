The application must be designed to accommodate different color schemes, branding options, and other customization features without compromising the user experience.
- Security: The chat application must be designed to ensure the safety and privacy of user data, including messages and personal information. The application must incorporate security features such as data encryption and two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
- User Experience: Developing a chat application that provides a great user experience is challenging as it requires a deep understanding of user behavior and preferences. The application must be designed to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that makes it easy for users to communicate and manage their conversations effectively.
## Risks:
The following are the Technical Risks involved:
- Performance issues: Developing a chat application that is highly responsive and scalable is challenging and involves significant technical risks. Performance issues such as latency, slow response times, and server overload can occur, affecting the user experience and overall application performance.
- Data security: Chat applications handle sensitive user data, and data security is a significant concern. Technical risks include data breaches, unauthorized access, and data loss due to system errors, system failures, or cyber-attacks.
- Compatibility issues: Chat applications must be compatible with a wide range of devices and platforms. Technical risks include compatibility issues, which can lead to poor user experience, application crashes, and reduced functionality.
- Real-time communication: Developing a chat application that supports real-time communication is technically challenging. Risks include message delays, message loss, and communication errors, which can affect the overall user experience and application performance.
- Customization challenges: Developing a fully customizable chat application is technically complex and involves significant risks. Risks include compatibility issues, performance issues, and usability challenges, which can affect the overall user experience and application performance.
### The following are the non-Technical Risks involved:
- Legal risks: Developing a chat application for freelancers involves legal risks, such as compliance with data privacy regulations, intellectual property rights, and user agreements.
- Market competition: The chat application market is highly competitive, and developing a chat application for freelancers may involve risks such as market saturation, market demand fluctuations, and fierce competition from established competitors.
- User adoption: The success of a chat application for freelancers depends on user adoption. Risks include low user adoption rates, user churn, and user dissatisfaction, which can impact the application's overall success.
- Financial risks: Developing a chat application for freelancers involves financial risks, such as budget overruns, unanticipated expenses, and revenue shortfalls, which can impact the overall financial viability of the project.
## Infrastructure: 
- Branching and Merging: 
Branching and merging in a team's repository for the development of a chat application for freelancers is a critical process that ensures the team can work collaboratively and efficiently. Here's a detailed process for branching and merging in a team's repository:

i. Identify the main/master branch
ii. Create a feature branch: Each member will create a feature branch for each new feature or functionality they are working on. The feature branch will be named after the feature or functionality they are working on and will be based on the main branch.
iii. Work on the feature branch: Each team member will make changes and updates on the feature branch while ensuring that they do not affect the main branch. It is essential to commit code changes regularly to the feature branch to track progress.
iv. Test the feature branch: Once the developer has completed work on the feature branch, they should test it thoroughly to ensure that it meets the required functionality and quality standards.
v. Merge the feature branch: If the feature branch has passed all the necessary tests, the developer should merge it with the main branch. This involves checking for any conflicts and resolving them.
vi. Review the merge: After merging the feature branch with the main branch, the team lead will review the merge to ensure that the code meets the necessary standards and does not break any existing features
vii. Deploy the code: Once the merge has been reviewed, and any necessary changes have been made, the code should be deployed to the production environment.
viii. Repeat the above process: Our team will repeat the above stated processes for each new feature or functionality we are working on, creating a new feature branch for each feature and merging it with the main branch after testing and review.

## Strategy for Deployment:


- Automate the deployment process: Automating the deployment process is essential to ensure that the process is reliable, repeatable, and consistent. Using tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or TravisCI, developers can automate the build, test, and deployment process.
- Use version control: Version control is essential for managing code changes and tracking the deployment process. Using a version control system like Git ensures that developers can track changes, roll back to previous versions, and manage code conflicts during deployment.
- Use a staging environment: Deploying code changes to a staging environment is essential to test the changes before deploying them to the production environment. The staging environment should be an exact replica of the production environment, allowing developers to test the changes in a realistic environment.
- Implement A/B testing: A/B testing is a useful technique for deploying code changes that involve significant changes to the application's functionality or user interface. This involves deploying the changes to a small group of users to test the impact before deploying to the entire user base.
- Monitor the deployment: Monitoring the deployment process is essential to identify and resolve issues quickly. Using tools like Nagios, New Relic, or Datadog, developers can monitor the application's performance, track errors, and identify bottlenecks during the deployment process.
- Rollback plan: It is important to have a rollback plan in case something goes wrong during the deployment process. This involves having a backup plan to roll back to the previous version of the application quickly.
- Document the deployment process: Documenting the deployment process is essential to ensure that the process is repeatable and consistent. Developers should create a deployment guide that documents the process, tools, and steps involved in deploying code changes.
- Data Population: We will populate our application using data from either google firebase Engine or from appEngine.io

## Tools: 
The following tools will be used:
- Selenium: code testing
- Vagrant: Code automation
## Existing Solutions:
Whatsapp for business 
Telegram
## Similarity: 
They are suitable for business chats
and can be easily automated.

## Dissimilarity:
The above stated apps have the drawbacks (which our app intends to address): 
- They are not customizable 
- They cannot be imbedded in a website 
- They are not responsive (Rather they have separate applications and mobile use)
